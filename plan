snake
~~movement of snake~~
you have a black grid for the background
each tile has the ability to turn white
so you have an frame and the game determines where the head will be in the next frame based on input that will be near the bottom so the input is registered first
at the very end of that frame it will find the square to the left right bottom or top of the head, turn that white
there will be a function in the map class that will set isWhite to true for any tile,it takes an array of indexes eg[[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]]each list in the array represents the individual tiles that we want to be white and it takes in the map list as a second parameter, searches the map for the nessacary tiles and sets it to white by calling the turn to white funtion for that tile or something
~how it will find where to move the snake head~
